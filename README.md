# angels-and-demons

I made this site because im a big fan on the supernatural series and thought it would be good to get some information on what the angel and demon characters are actually based on.

## making this project

Making this site was fun, i got into the wiki api a lot deeper than my last project and starting to understand axios a bit better.
Im still a bit sketchy on vuex i feel i could of used it better than i did atleast i used the api in the store this time,
theres still work i need to do as of the time of writing this like the demons are not fully checked and fixed so some of them will bring up black pages theres a lot to go through, all angels have been checked and all work.


## tech used

 - vue/vuex
 - vuetify
 - html/css
 - javascript
 - axios
 - wiki API
 
 ## future improvements
 
- fix all demon pages.
- images layout could be better.
- archangel page
