# angels-and-demons

I made this site because im a big fan of the supernatural series and thought it would be good to get some information on what the angel and demon characters are actually based on.

## making this project

Making this site was fun, i got into the wiki api a lot deeper than my last project and starting to understand axios a bit better.
Im still a bit sketchy on vuex i feel i could of used it better than i did, atleast i used the api in the store this time. angels and demons pages fully working now, the pictures still need work.


## tech used

 - vue/vuex
 - vuetify
 - html/css
 - javascript
 - axios
 - wiki API
 
 ## future improvements
 
- ~~fix all demon pages.~~ (fixed)
- images layout could be better.
- archangel page
